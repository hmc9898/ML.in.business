# Oil Well Profit Prediction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes geological data from three potential oil fields to determine which region is most financially viable for drilling. Using regression models and bootstrapping, the goal was to predict oil production volumes, calculate expected profits, and assess the risk of financial loss. The final recommendation identifies the region with the best balance of high returns and low risk.

## Objectives

- Build a regression model to predict the volume of recoverable oil  
- Simulate revenue and profit distributions for each region  
- Apply bootstrapping to assess financial risk  
- Recommend a region based on profitability and risk thresholds

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach

- Trained a Linear Regression model on historical data from each region  
- Simulated drilling outcomes using bootstrapping to model uncertainty  
- Compared average profits and risk of loss across regions  
- Used break-even and confidence interval analysis to support investment decisions

## Key Insights

- One region showed the highest average predicted profit with a relatively low risk of loss  
- Bootstrapped simulations revealed that not all high-output wells translated to financial gain  
- Data-driven selection supports smarter capital allocation in oil field development
